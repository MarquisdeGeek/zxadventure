## About

With everyone talking about making retro games (but actually making modern games with a retro visual
look) I decided to make a <i>real</i> retro game. In machine code. On the Spectrum.

## How to play

* Press 'space' to start
* Use the keys 'z', 'x', 'k', and 'm' to move around the map
* The goal is to find the chalice, and return it to the inside your castle
* You can only carry one item at a time
* If you approach the dragon, without a sword, he will kill you
